The goal of this project is to predict whether a patient has covid or not according to several variables using machine learning classification algorithms. 

## Run the code
To see the project, run the code "Projet_Covid19.ipynb". 

## Models 
1. Decision Tree.
2. Random Forest.
4. K Nearest Neighbors.
5. Support vector machine.

## Metric 
The metric used to evaluate the quality of the model is F1 score. 

F1 Score is the weighted average of Precision and Recall. Therefore, this score takes both false positives and false negatives into account. Intuittively it's not as easy to understand as accuracy, but F1 is usually more useful than accuracy, especially fi you have an uneven class distribution. Accuracy works best if false positives and false negative have similar cost. If the cost of false positive and false negative are very different, it's better to look at booth Precision and Reccal.
